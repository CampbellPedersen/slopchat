Stand out from the crowd by having AI write your chat messages for you! Who knows, maybe Atrioc will notice your message and whoosh you onto screen! What a thrill! Please, use this codebase responsibly!

## Features
- Seamlessly send AI-generated messages to Atrioc's Twitch chat, you're basically a bot anyway
- Generates relevant chat messages by checking Atrioc's Twitch stream title, category and chat messages
- Shares the latest hot trends from the /r/atrioc subreddit so you can automatically repost Spoontrioc
- Repost top news stories so you don't have to read them yourself or critically think at all
- Shamelessly login using your own Twitch account so you can be recognised for all your efforts

## Constraints
- You must either be me or be following me on Twitch to use this service
